Title: Get Started with Flotiq API Integration

Description: Get started with integrating Flotiq API into your application.

!!! note "Before you begin, make sure you have the following:"
    * Flotiq Account: Sign up for an account on Flotiq website if you haven't already.
    * API Key: Obtain your Application Read and Write API Key from the Flotiq dashboard. You'll need it to perform API operations.
    * Basic understanding of RESTful APIs: Familiarize yourself with the concepts of RESTful APIs if you're new to this.

#### Step 1: Creating Content Type Definitions
To start using Flotiq API, you need to define your content types. Content Type represents a model of data defined within the Content Repository. There are two ways to create a Content Type:

* Via API: You can programmatically create a Content Type by sending a properly formatted POST request to the 
/api/v1/internal/contenttype endpoint. [Check it here](content-type/creating-ctd.md) to know more about it.

* Using our Flotiq's content type editor: Flotiq provides a convenient Content Modeler tool within the platform for creating Content Types visually. You can access it through the Flotiq dashboard.

#### Step 2: Implementing API Integration
Once you have defined your Content Types, you can proceed with integrating Flotiq API into your application. Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

* Authentication: Use your [API key](index.md) to authenticate API requests. Include the key in the request headers or as a query parameter, depending on the API endpoint.
* Data Manipulation: Perform CRUD operations ([Create](content-type/creating-ctd.md), [Read](content-type/getting-ctd.md), [Update](content-type/updating-ctd.md), [Delete](content-type/deleting-ctd.md)) on your Content Types using the appropriate API endpoints and HTTP methods.
* Handling Responses: Handle the API responses in your application code to process the data returned by the API and handle errors gracefully.
* Testing and Debugging: Use tools like CURL or Postman to test your API requests and ensure they are working as expected.
* Best Practices: Follow best practices for API integration, such as using pagination for large result sets, implementing caching mechanisms, and handling rate limits.

For detailed instructions on implementing API integration, refer to the API Integration Guide.

#### Step 3: Exploring Advanced Features
Flotiq API offers various advanced features and functionalities to enhance your application. Here are a few examples:

* Search: Perform advanced [search queries](search.md) to retrieve specific data from your Content Types.
* Media Management: Upload and [manage media](media-library.md) assets such as images and videos in your application.

To explore these features and more, refer to the Advanced Features Documentation.

Congratulations! You now have a basic understanding of integrating Flotiq API into your application. Start by creating your Content Type Definitions and then follow the API integration steps to build powerful applications using Flotiq.
