# Importing example data for Gatsby starters with Flotiq CLI

To importing example data for a Gatsby starter with Flotiq CLI you need a Flotiq account (you can [register here](http://editor.flotiq.com/register.html)), your "Read and write API key" (more about API keys [here](../API/index.md)), and a clone of one of our [Gatsby starters](#gatsby-starters).

The command looks like this:

```bash
flotiq import [flotiqApiKey] [projectName]
```

After running the command, you should have data imported to your Flotiq account.

### Parameters

`flotiqApiKey` - API key to your Flotiq account

`projectName` - project name or project path (if you wish to start or import data from the directory you are in, use `.`)
