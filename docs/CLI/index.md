# Flotiq CLI

## Overview

We've prepared Flotiq CLI to help launch Flotiq projects even faster than before. 

For now the set of commands is limited for Gatsby users - you can now clone a Gatsby starter, install dependencies, import data to Flotiq, and start the project with [exactly one command](./starting-new-project.md).

Importing example data is also more straightforward - if you already cloned one of the Gatsby starter repositories you can simply import the examples with [import data command](./importing-data.md).

If you want to migrate any blog from WordPress to Flotiq it's really simple! All you need to do is to use one command and Flotiq CLI will do all the hard work for you. You can read more on that in [wordpress import command](./wordpress-importer.md).

## Installation

!!! Warning
       You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 9 or higher to install and use Flotiq CLI.
