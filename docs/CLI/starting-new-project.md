# Starting new Gatsby project with Flotiq CLI

To start a new Gatsby project with Flotiq CLI you need a Flotiq account (you can [register here](http://editor.flotiq.com/register.html)) and your "Read and write API key" (more about API keys [here](../API/index.md)).

The command looks like this:

```bash
flotiq start [flotiqApiKey] [projectName] [flotiqStarterUrl]
```

After running the command, you should have new project cloned with installed dependencies, data imported to your Flotiq account and started server with the project.

### Parameters

`flotiqApiKey` - API key to your Flotiq account

`projectName` - project name or project path (if you wish to start or import data from current directory - use `.`)

`flotiqStarterUrl` - full link to GatsbyJs starter, the list below
